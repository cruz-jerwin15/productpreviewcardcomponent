## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

This is my second challenge and I learned a lot. I learn on how to use a landmark (from the feedback of my first challenge). Create a responsive web app using the Mobile-first approach.





### Continued development
I want to focus first on how I can improve my designing skills for small components with the use of HTML and CSS only.
